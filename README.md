                    listen [::]:80;
                    server_name hotel.loc www.hotel.loc;
                    root /var/www/html/hotel.loc;
                    index index.html index.php;
                    location / {
                        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
                    }
                    location ~ .php$ {
                        try_files $uri =404;
                        fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+.php)(/.+)$;
                        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;
                        fastcgi_index index.php;
                        fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME  /var/www/html/hotel.loc$fastcgi_script_name;
                        include fastcgi_params;
                    }
                }
    When youâ€™ve made the above changes, you can save and close the file.
    Test your configuration file for syntax errors by typing:
    - sudo nginx -t
    When you are ready, reload Nginx to make the necessary changes:
    - sudo systemctl reload nginx
    Install MySQL, a database management system, to store and manage the data for our site.
    You can install this easily by typing: (Currently used version is 8.0.31)
    - sudo apt-get install mysql-server
    ou will be asked to supply a root (administrative) password for use within the MySQL system.
    The MySQL database software is now installed, but its configuration is not exactly complete yet.
    To secure the installation, we can run a simple security script that will ask whether we want to modify some insecure defaults. Begin the script by typing:
    - mysql_secure_installation
    Set your db username and pass
    Clone git repo inside your root folder (Currently is /var/www/html/hotel.loc)
    
## Hot to use the Project    

    Connect to your database
    Create your database (currently created db name is hotel)
    For test information you can import hotel.sql into your db. File located inside database folder.
    Start your services:
    - sudo service nginx start
    - sudo service php8.1-fpm start
    - sudo service mysql start

    Enjoy !!!

## Test and Deploy

You can test after doing all installation steps which are described above. For that used DatePicker demo version, also I have print all data, which you can find inside your browser developer tools, under Network section. If you don't want to run the whole application, you can use Postman or Swagger tools to send appropriate requests and receive responses. 
For that you can find requests collections file inside Document folder.
